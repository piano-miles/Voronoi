# Voronoi
A program written in Processing, which renders a Voronoi distribution, also known as cell noise. 

Note, this program will render a sequence of pngs of moving horizontally over a tilable voronoi tesselation into the .pde's folder. 
When finished rendering, it will exit the program.
This is not an interactive program, and the pngs can be stiched together in an editing program like Blender3D.
